#### Time Complexity Analysis:
- The time complexity of the code depends on the underlying implementation of the `translate` method from the `googletrans` library. Without specific knowledge of the implementation, it is difficult to provide an exact time complexity analysis. However, we can make some assumptions based on typical translation algorithms:
1. **Translator Initialization**: The time complexity of initializing the `translator` object is typically O(1) as it involves setting up the necessary data structures and configurations.
2. **Translation**: The time complexity of the `translate` method depends on the length of the input text and the complexity of the translation algorithm used. In general, translation algorithms have a time complexity of at least O(n), where n is the length of the input text. However, the actual time complexity can vary depending on the specific implementation.


#### Possible Time Complexity Optimizations:
- Since the code relies on an external library (`googletrans`), the potential for time complexity optimizations is limited. However, you can consider the following:
1. **Caching Translations**: If you frequently translate the same text, you can implement a caching mechanism to store previously translated texts and retrieve them instead of making a new translation request. This can significantly reduce the translation time for repeated texts.

#### Amortized Time Analysis:
- Without specific knowledge of the implementation details, it is challenging to provide an amortized time analysis for the code.
